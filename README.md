*description*
This is a recipe sharing website where you can share your favourite recipes, along with the tags, and submit it. Everything asked for the lab has been staisfied along iwth all the extra credits.


## What Worked Well
Everything worked well for me.


## Extra Credit
- I have tailored this to a recipe platform, which qualifies as using the CRUD structure for a purpose other than a standard blog.
- I have implemented a filter by tags functionality in the RecipeList, which counts for extra credit.
- i have implemented input validation correctly in form submissions, this would count as extra credit.
- if you click on the logo, you go to the  home button.
